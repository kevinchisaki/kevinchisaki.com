      <h2>About The Project</h2>
      <h3 id="guitar-center-tags">MOBILE <span class="slash">/</span> UX <span class="slash">/</span> IDENTITY <span class="slash">/</span> MOTION</h3>
      <p>For this project, I wanted to do a little more than just rebrand Guitar Center. I wanted to improve the shopping experience for in-store customers and the way they navigate around the store, as well as improve the bandwidth for Guitar Center associates so they can be available for questions and checkout procedures.  </p>
      <p>As a new musician, Guitar Center can be very overwhelming seeing all of the different types of products that the store has to offer and finding a starting point can be difficult.  </p>
      <p>I was a new musician myself, and for me it was awkward to talk to a sale associate as a newbie. Some of the sales associates were also busy talking with other customers as well so I found myself on my own searching for my first guitar. What if there was a digital display that recommends products and helps customers find products on an in-door map around the store?</p>

      <h2>Search by skill level</h2>
      <p>I thought it would be an awesome feature for users to search for an instrument by skill level. This can help all types of customers find a new instrument from experienced to newbies. The recommendations can be compiled by proffesionals and Guitar Center associates, categorized into the three categories: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. </p>

      <h2>Specifications &amp; Artists</h2>
      <p>Specifications are an important aspect to every person looking for a new instrument.  What material is it made of? How big is it? Etc. Along with that, I thought it would be a cool feature to see your instrument in action. See your instrument in a music video being played by other famous artists that use the same instrument.</p>

      <h2>Going Mobile</h2>
      <p>Overall, I feel that the kiosk solution will help Guitar Center’s flow of the store but there is still a danger of causing lines at kiosks due to those who love researching for a very long time before they purchase a product. I am in the process of creating a mobile version of the kiosk for customers to use as an option. This will give customers their own space to do their research on a purchase without having to wait for a kiosk to be available.</p>

      <h2>Behind The Mark</h2>
      <p>Guitar Center is not just about guitars anymore. Guitar Center is now the world’s largest retailer of guitars, amplifiers, drums, keyboards, recording equipment, live sound,  DJ and lighting equipment throughout the US.   While thinking about what kind of store Guitar Center is today, I wanted to re-imagine the logo focused on “sound” but keep the guitar aspect of the name.</p>
